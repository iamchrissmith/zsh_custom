## Odin - Git flavored zsh [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tylerreckart/Odin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tylerreckart/Odin) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/tylerreckart/odin](https://badges.gitter.im/tylerreckart/odin.svg)](https://gitter.im/tylerreckart/odin?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Odin is a [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) shell theme that focused around a git based workflow that provides you with a comprehensive overview of your projects status without overcrowding your shell.

If you have any other issues, see the [oh-my-zsh documentation](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Customization) for more info.

2. `zgen save` and zgen will automatically handle cloning the repository for you.

## Color schemes  
Odin comes packaged with two color schemes, however you can customize Odin with whatever color scheme you like. Color schemes can be found in the `colors` folder.

## Options  
Odin is highly configurable. It was build to seamlessly integrate git into my workflow, but my choices may not work for you. Everything from the icons to colors are customizable to whatever you will. Want to slap some emoji in there? Go for it!

## Git  
Included in the project repo is a git folder, which contains two subfolders with git configuration settings. The config folder holds a `.gitconfig` file. This file contains all of the aliases and git settings that I use in my day-to-day workflow. Also included is a `.gitmessage` file, which allows for you to customize what you see when you make a commit. Just copy those over to your home directory and you'll be set (you'll have to fill in your info in the `.gitconfig` file to get everything working).

## [Tmux](https://tmux.github.io/) 
Odin works great with tmux. Included in the project repo is a `tmux` folder, which contains all of my preferences for utilizing tmux in tandem with Odin.

## Credits
Odin is highly inspired by [jacobthemyth](http://github.com/jacobthemyth/dotfiles)'s personal zsh shell.

Special thanks to [Joe Block](https://github.com/unixorn) for adding Odin to his list of [awesome zsh plugins](https://github.com/unixorn/awesome-zsh-plugins)
